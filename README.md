Programs
========

### exports/udpchat.jar
A chat client using UDP Multicat.
You can execute it by double click, or,
`java -jar udpchat.jar`
in terminal.

If you prefer CUI access, you may add '-c' option to run in Console mode. Like 
`java -jar udpchat.jar -c`
Buf for now, Console mode is a bit buggy.

### exports/udpchat.py
This has same funcition as exports/udpchat.jar but implemented by Python.
__NOTE: This program requires Python 3.x and above to run__
